# Usage details

[README](../README.md) | [한국어](usage.ko.md)

## Platform support

Core workbranch commands are supported on macOS, Linux, and WSL. Tool app launchers are macOS-only because the built-in app presets use macOS `open` and macOS app names.

Supported everywhere: Git/worktree commands, `path`, `list`, `memo`, `noti`, `status`, `config`, `init`, and generated CLI distribution checks.

macOS-only: `finder`, `ide`, `terminal`, `config ide`, and `config terminal`. On Linux/WSL, full `workbranch config` and `workbranch init` stay available and skip tool app prompts.

## Common commands

### Workspace lifecycle

| Command                                  | Use it to                                                                    |

| `workbranch config ide`                  | Update only the configured IDE command                                       |

Add `--repo <repo>` to supported Branch workflow and Tool commands when you want to operate on one repo only.

## CLI display

In an interactive terminal, `workbranch` uses color, a compact banner on help/init screens, and section titles to make command output easier to scan. Captured or piped output stays plain by default so scripts and tests do not receive ANSI escape sequences.

Color controls:

```bash
NO_COLOR=1 workbranch help              # always plain
WORKBRANCH_COLOR=never workbranch help  # always plain
WORKBRANCH_COLOR=always workbranch help # force enhanced display
```

`workbranch path <task>` and `workbranch path <task> --repo <repo>` remain plain path-only outputs for scripting.

## Task brief and notifications

`workbranch add <task>` creates `<task>/TASK-WORKBRANCH.md` and generated `<task>/AGENTS.md` at the task root, outside repo worktrees. Agents should run from `<task>` by default; code changes and Git commands belong in `<task>/<repo>`. The generated guidance points both locations at the same task brief. Workbranch does not edit repo `.gitignore` for this state. `PREFERRED_LANGUAGE en|ko` controls the generated task brief and agent guidance language; set it with `workbranch config language`.

The default task brief format is shared by humans, agents, `workbranch list --json`, and companion apps:

```markdown
# <task>
status: todo
```

The first `#` heading names the current Plan; a newly generated brief starts with the task name. The immediately following `status:` line is the source of truth and may be `todo`, `planning`, `in-progress`, `review`, `blocked`, or `done`. Update that line when the task moves through the normal `todo → planning → in-progress → review → done` flow, moving `todo` to `planning` immediately when meaningful work begins, including planning itself. Keep an optional one-line current-work summary directly below `status:` and refresh it when the focus changes. `workbranch list --json` exposes it as `plans[].summary`; the parser reads the first eligible non-empty line after `status:` before any checklist item, otherwise `summary` is empty. `blocked` is an execution-only pause: enter it only from `in-progress` and restore `in-progress` when unblocked. Add checklists, `plan:` metadata, or notes only when the user explicitly requests them.

For compatibility with older briefs, the parser still derives status and progress from Markdown checklist items when an explicit `status:` line is absent: no completed work is `todo`, partial work is `in-progress`, and all items complete is `done`. Completed items count toward `progressDone`, all items count toward `progressTotal`, and the first unchecked item becomes `currentItem`. Schema v1 also retains `memoTitle` as a legacy alias for the first H1, but the Companion domain model does not depend on it.

Use `workbranch memo <task>` to print the task brief, `workbranch memo <task> "text"` to overwrite it, and `workbranch memo <task> --clear` to remove it. From inside a registered task workspace, the task may be omitted only for reading: `workbranch memo` prints the current task brief. Writes and clears require an explicit task argument.

Notifications are append-only JSON Lines at `<task>/.workbranch/notifications.jsonl`. `workbranch noti add <task> "text"` appends one event, `workbranch noti list <task>` prints notification text oldest-first, and `workbranch noti clear <task>` clears the inbox. Companion apps should read `notiCount`, `planTitle`, `status`, `progressDone`, `progressTotal`, `currentItem`, `updatedAt`, and plan-level `summary` from `workbranch list --json` and may call `noti list` / `noti clear` for details and acknowledgement. The current Companion shows `+N` on StageBoard cards only.

`workbranch remove <task>` removes task worktrees, local task branches, and known generated task-root state: `TASK-WORKBRANCH.md`, generated `AGENTS.md`, `.workbranch/`, and `.workbranch.task`. Everything else left in the task root, including `.omx/` and `.omc/`, is not git-managed. Normal remove prints those remaining item names and, in an interactive shell, asks once whether to delete the entire task root. No/EOF keeps the task root. `workbranch remove <task> --force` still runs the normal safety preflights, then deletes the task root without prompting.

## Project health

Run `workbranch doctor` to diagnose base worktree drift, partial task workspaces, stale task directories, and stale Git worktree registrations. It is read-only by default and exits non-zero when it finds issues, so it can be used in local checks or CI.

Use `workbranch doctor --fix` for the safe repair path. It only runs `git worktree prune` for in-scope base repos; it never deletes task directories or branches. For destructive cleanup, follow the printed `workbranch remove <task>` or `workbranch remove <task> --force` hint yourself. Add `--repo <repo>` to scope diagnosis and pruning to one repo.

## Shell completion

Generate shell completion scripts with `workbranch completion <shell>`. The script provides command, task key, repo, and option completion through your shell; display color and dimmed preview styling are controlled by your shell, completion framework, and terminal theme.

```bash
# bash
workbranch completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/workbranch

# zsh: write to a directory on fpath
workbranch completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_workbranch"

# fish
workbranch completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/workbranch.fish
```

## Opening task workspaces

Configure one IDE and one terminal command for the project, and optionally the language used by generated task guidance:

```bash
workbranch config ide
workbranch config terminal
workbranch config language
```

Then open task surfaces:

```bash
workbranch finder login      # task root in Finder
workbranch ide login         # repo worktrees in the IDE
workbranch terminal login    # task root in the terminal
```

Built-in macOS IDE presets open each repo path in a separate IDE window for VS Code-like apps. The config directive is `IDE <command>`; preset order is Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurf, Zed, Sublime Text, Xcode, then VS Code. Existing `IDE open -a Cursor`, `IDE open -a "Antigravity IDE"`, `IDE open -a "Visual Studio Code"`, or `IDE open -a Windsurf` command shapes are launched as `open -na ... --args --new-window` for the same behavior. Zed remains `open -na Zed` until its CLI contract is verified.

Limit to one repo when needed:

```bash
workbranch ide login --repo frontend
workbranch terminal login --repo backend
```

Print full paths for scripting:

```bash
workbranch path login
workbranch path login --repo frontend
```

`workbranch ide <task>` runs repo-by-repo. `workbranch terminal <task>` opens the task root once so an agent can see `AGENTS.md`, `TASK-WORKBRANCH.md`, and all repos. Use `--repo` when you intentionally want either launcher scoped to one repo.

## Setup commands

`workbranch config` can store a setup command per repo. When you run `workbranch add <task>`, each setup command runs inside `<task>/<repo>`.

See the [MVP spec](specs/0001-workbranch-mvp.md) for the config format and setup environment variables.

## Safety

Before changing worktrees, `workbranch` checks for dirty worktrees, wrong branches, rebase state, missing repos, and non-fast-forward Git paths.

When a preflight detects a rebase conflict, diverged pull path, or non-fast-forward land path, it stops before changing the target worktree and prints the manual commands for that exact repo. The guidance may tell you to inspect moved refs with `git fetch` and `git log --left-right`, or to run `workbranch update <task> --repo <repo>` before landing. Resolve the conflict or non-fast-forward state outside `workbranch`, then rerun the original `workbranch` or `workbranch land` command.
